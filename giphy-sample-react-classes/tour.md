# React with Classes Overview and Tour

[Start here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to get to know React with classes.

## Code Entry Points
* Browser entry: _index.html_
* JavaScript entry: _index.js_
* Application entry: _App.js_ (this is most likely the file where you will start making changes)

## Basic Code-Reading Tips
* Use the `import` statements to figure out where to find what source code
* React with classes defines a React component as a `class` that extends `Component` with, at a minimum, a `render` method whose return value is the content of that component
* Use browser tools (particularly element inspector) to understand how React code eventually becomes web code
