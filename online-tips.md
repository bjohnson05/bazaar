# e-Learning with e-Dondi: Tips and Tricks
Welcome to the wild and woolly world of learning things exclusively via online resources! This may be very new to you, especially if the shift is made on short notice, so I’ve written a few notes that you might find useful.

## Take Care of Yourself First
By all means, make sure you are in a good situation first in terms of health, housing, food, etc. before worrying about any of this. Just send me a note on how things are with you and we’ll work something out.

## Learning Online is Useful Outside of a Pandemic
One quick point of perspective: learning how to learn in this manner will serve you well way beyond the immediate moment. When you fully launch into a career in computing, you’ll find that learning in this way will be quite useful, as new technologies emerge and the only resources about these technologies will be available solely online at first. Thus, if you get the hang of it now, you are picking up a skill that you will find handy for a _long_ time to come.

## Things That Don’t Change
Many aspects of the way that I already teach computer science courses will not change. So if you’re used to them, then great. If you aren’t, then this is a good time to check them out:
* I will continue to post screen recordings of class sessions as private YouTube videos
* Links to these videos will continue to be accumulated in Brightspace (under _Content > Screengrab Videos_)
* I will continue to be available via email or Slack for any questions or other interactions
* Assignments will continue to be submitted via GitHub Classroom
* Feedback will continue to be committed to the GitHub repository of the corresponding assignment
* Grades will continue to be entered in Brightspace

## Things That Are Different
OK, so now here are the adjustments that we’ll have to make.

### Classes
I will continue to hold classes at our scheduled times via Zoom. But again, _see the first section_. I will record those Zoom sessions just as I always have, so if you are more comfortable with watching the screengrabs later, then that is perfectly OK.

For all Zoom-related activities, I will be available at this link: https://lmula.zoom.us/my/dondi

Just go there in order to “attend class.” See the section below for some tips on getting the most out of this medium.

### Office Hours
I will continue to be available at my pre-scheduled office hours. The only change is that, instead of physically going to my office, you would just go to this link: https://lmula.zoom.us/my/dondi

Yup, it’s the same one that I’ll be using for class.

Further, I will remain reachable (as before) via email (dondi@lmu.edu) or Slack (@dondi in the Slack LMUCS workspace).

### Slack Channels
* Mention #cmsi284 and #cmsi355

### Online Presence Tips
(to be refined)

* We’ll need to be flexible and go with the flow
* Watch your email closely than you usually do
    * Email will be the foundation of all communications—when in doubt, check email
    * Everyone has email; it is the least demanding medium to check; it just needs to become more of a habit
* Video meetings use finite resources (as with all things in computing except for theory)
    * It might go down; you can try again as needed but don’t worry if you can’t reconnect; we’ll figure it out
    * As long as I am able to do so, I will continue to record things; if not, we’ll readjust as needed
* Mute when needed
* Turn off video if bandwidth seems shaky
* Use the chat panel; I’ll keep it open
* Even with today’s high bandwidth, audio will have a slight delay—give people time to respond, perhaps speak a little more slowly, and pause a little more between sentences
