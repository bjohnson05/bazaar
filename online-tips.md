# e-Learning with e-Dondi, Tips and Tricks
Welcome to the wild and woolly world of learning things exclusively via online resources! This may be very new to you, especially if the shift is made on short notice, so I’ve written a few notes that you might find useful.

## Take Care of Yourself First
By all means, make sure you are in a good situation first in terms of health, housing, food, etc. before worrying about any of this. Just send me a note on how things are with you and we’ll work something out.

## Learning Online is Useful Outside of a Pandemic
One quick point of perspective: learning how to learn in this manner will serve you well way beyond the immediate moment. When you fully launch into a career in computing, you’ll find that learning in this way will be quite useful, as new technologies emerge and the only resources about these technologies will be available solely online at first. Thus, if you get the hang of it now, you are picking up a skill that you will find handy for a _long_ time to come.

## Things That Don’t Change
Many aspects of the way that I already teach computer science courses will not change. So if you’re used to them, then great. If you aren’t, then this is a good time to check them out:
* I will continue to post screen recordings of class sessions as private YouTube videos
* Links to these videos will continue to be accumulated in Brightspace (under _Content > Screengrab Videos_)
* I will continue to be available via email or Slack for any questions or other interactions
* Assignments will continue to be submitted via GitHub Classroom
* Feedback will continue to be committed to the GitHub repository of the corresponding assignment
* Grades will continue to be entered in Brightspace

## Things That Are Different
OK, so now here are the adjustments that we’ll have to make.
